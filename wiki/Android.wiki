#summary One Day Soon, Torora Might Work on Android!

= It kind of already does. =

= However, there are a couple of things blocking: =

[http://sourceforge.net/p/necessitas/tickets/27/ Android's CA cert bundle is not compatible with Qt] and there is no obvious or easy way to fix that without Ministro/Necessitas or Torora shipping a certificate bundle of its own.
